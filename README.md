## **Challenges & Solutions**

* **API Activation Delay:** A lot of APIs on RapidAPI have a lot of bugs. Also, OpenWeatherMap API keys can take up to 2 hours to activate. If you get an ‚ÄúInvalid API key‚Äù error, just wait and try again. I battled with these errors for hours.
* **Deployment:** Used Docker for consistent local/cloud deployment and Render.com for easiest public hosting.
* **UI/UX:** Ensured a modern, responsive layout by strictly using split layout and clear error feedback.
